I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Ninghui Li](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui).


I have been very fortunate to work with Prof. [Yunjun Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gaoyj_en) at Zhejiang University <img src='/assets/img/zju_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">, with Prof. [Zhikun Zhang](http://zhangzhk.com/) at Stanford University <img src='/assets/img/stanford_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">, with Prof. [Christian S. Jensen](https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~csj/) at Aalborg University <img src='/assets/img/aau_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">,  with Prof. [Baihua Zheng](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/zheng-baihua-521) at Singapore Management University <img src='/assets/img/smu_logo.svg' style="width: 3.5em;">, with Dr. [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and Dr. [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) <img src='/assets/img/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;">.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
